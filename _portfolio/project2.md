This is a two minutes animation made with blender. I took an animation class about 3 months after I started learning 3D modeling and inspired by kimetsu no yaiba, I decided to make short animation of two samuria fight each other as my final project for my animation class. Learning how to animate and rig the character was challeneging but also very rewarding at the same time.[Link to google drive to watch the animation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mki4mo5tkck4fodL2_zpv9WGfEApmnsf/view?usp=sharing)
